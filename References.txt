Sorry I almost forgot to add this which is why it was added so late
I feel bad because I forgot the links the youtube videos
References/Code I looked at:

Unity Documentation for things like
- character controllers
- movement
- scene managers
- rigid bodies (I don't think I used code from it but I don't remember)
- files (didn't end up using)

Nick's .DLL code from the tutorial

Youtube for things like
- Highscore boards (didn't work out)
- camera movement
- How the UI elements can be used in Unity (text objects, panels, canvas, etc)
